Step1: first run the train python file

In the above code the model is trained with the different datasets.

Step2: Then run in master code
In this code the image which was captured will be compared by the datasets and it prints the emotion and later it plays the songs.

ABSTRACT



Music has a direct effect on our hormones. If you listen to music  you enjoy, it decreases levels of the hormone cortisol
in your body, counteracting the effects of chronic stress. Stress causes 60% of all illnesses and diseases, so lower levels of stress  mean higher chances of overall well-being.



The latest study from Nielsen Music shows 90 percent of the            population listens to music and that, on average,
 They do so 32.1 hours a week. So  listening songs according to one’s   mood/emotion plays a vital role.


Our project mainly
 deals with identification of a person’s mood and playing similar songs according to it like if a person is happy
 he may wish to listen hit songs or latest songs, similarly if he is angry
he may wish to listen to melodies to    get control on his mood etc..

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


As music has many benefits, the music must match according to the user mood/emotion if not it may lead to frustration and anger. So the similar songs recommendation system plays a
crucial role in day to day life for music lovers.

INTRODUCTION


•PURPOSE OF PLAN :
 	According to one research, it has been proved that the systems of our body react sensitively to music. When slow rhythms are played, our blood pressure and heartbeat slow down which helps us breathe more slowly, thus reducing muscle tension in our neck, shoulders, stomach and back. Music can help in many aspects of the brain, including pain reduction, stress relief, memory, and brain injuries. So the Similar Songs Recommendation system becomes important.


•PROJECT OBJECTIVES :
 	In this project we will be scanning the face of the user and analyse the emotion of the user and the system will play the songs which match that emotion.


•PROJECT GOALS :

  1. Train the model by giving datasets of emotions as input and categorise them accordingly.

  2. Assign music/songs to the emotions which the model was trained.

  3. Scan the face of the user and match with the datasets if it matches with the data it prints the emotion else prints that the emotion was not defined/Rescan.

FINDINGS 

After the scanning of the image our model will match this scanned image with the data sets by which it was trained and recommends the songs which matches with the Emotion scanned.
Our accuracy level of our model is around 70%. It can be increased by following the below mentioned steps :

• Giving more data while training. More data means more accuracy.

• By adding more features.

• By using Higher Level Algorithms.

FUTURE SCOPE



In the world right now the emerging field is machine learning and it has become the course for the graduates to develop the technology.

             In means of that we have started a project on the music player with the face recognition which could play the song on basis of our emotions. Music has become the daily routine of people and making selection of the songs is also important so instead of selecting it by going through the procedure it could be easy for people to change the emotions to play a song. The generation has become materialistic in the emotions so they can have the emotions in their life .

CONCLUSIONS

The product has been designed by training the module using
250 images for each emotion and it is trained for doing the work for following emotions:

•	Anger

•	Fear

•	Happy

•	Sad

•	Surprise


By the emotions it will paly the songs related to the genre and this is identified by using the face recognition through the python software by the help of open cv. The main important part of the program is to train this model for the above emotions mentioned.
